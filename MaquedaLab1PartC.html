    <li>Cooking spray</li>
    <li>1 (1/4-oz.) packet active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1/2 cup warm milk</li>
    <li>4 1/2 cups (540 g.) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (100 g.) granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup (53 g.) packed light brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 tsp. kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 tsp. pumpkin spice</li>
    <li>1 large egg, room temperature</li>
    <li>1 cup pumpkin puree</li>
    <li>4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, softened</li>
  </ul> 

  <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cooking spray</li>
      <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, softened</li>
      <li>1/2 cup (107 g.) packed light brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 tsp. pumpkin spice</li>
      <li>1 tsp. ground cinnamon </li>
    </ul>
  
  <h3>Frosting</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>4 oz. cream cheese softened</li>
    <li>4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>1 cup (113 g.) confectioners’ sugar </li>
    <li>1 Tbsp. pumpkin pie spice, plus more for topping </li>
    <li>2 tsp. instant coffee </li>
    <li>2 Tbsp. warm milk</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <h3>Dough</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Grease a large bowl with cooking spray. In a small bowl, sprinkle yeast over milk and let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>In the large bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, mix flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, and pumpkin pie spice until combined. With the mixer on low speed, add egg, pumpkin puree, and yeast mixture. Mix, scraping down sides of bowl, until combined, about 1 minute. Add butter, 1 Tbsp. at a time, and mix to combine.</li>
      <li>Increase mixer speed to medium and mix until dough sticks to sides of bowl but pulls away when scraped, about 10 minutes. Transfer dough to prepared bowl and cover with a clean kitchen towel. Place in a warm spot and let rise until not quite doubled in size and dough springs back when poked, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Grease a 13" x 9" baking dish with cooking spray. In a small bowl, mix butter, brown sugar, pumpkin pie spice, and cinnamon until combined.</li>
      <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to an 18" x 14" rectangle. Using an offset spatula, spread filling over dough. Starting at one long edge, roll dough into a tight log and trim ends with a sharp knife. Cut log into 12 (1 1/2"-thick) pieces. If dough seems very soft and squishy, you can cut the 18" x 14" rectangle into 12 (1 1/2") strips and individually roll up.</li>
      <li>Arrange rolls flat sides down in prepared dish. Cover and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Arrange a rack in center of oven; preheat to 400°. Uncover and bake rolls until lightly golden brown, about 30 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Frosting</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In the large bowl of stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or in a large bowl using a handheld mixer), beat cream cheese and butter on medium-high speed until fluffy and smooth. Add confectioners’ sugar and pumpkin pie spice and continue to beat on medium speed until combined.</li>
      <li>In a small bowl, dissolve instant coffee in milk. Pour mixture into frosting and beat until smooth and incorporated.</li>
      <li>Using an offset spatula, spread frosting over rolls, then sprinkle with more pumpkin pie spice.</li>
    </ol>
