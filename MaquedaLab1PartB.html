  <h2>What is a DOCTYPE Statement?</h2>
  <p>All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.

The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.</p>

<h2> How do you use: &lt;ol&gt;; &lt;ul&gt;; &lt;dl&gt; ?</h2>
<p>An ordered list starts with the &lt;ol&gt; tag. Each list item starts with the &lt;li&gt; tag.

An unordered list starts with the &lt;ul&gt; tag. Each list item starts with the &lt;li&gt;tag.
The list items will be marked with bullets (small black circles) by default:

The &lt;dl &gt;tag defines a description list.The &lt;dl&gt; tag is used in conjunction with &lt;dt&gt; (defines terms/names) and &lt;dd&gt; (describes each term/name).</p>

<h2> Difference between text editor and word processor?</h2>
<p> A word processor processes the words with pages and paragraphs. It is a processor that provides the basic editing, input, formatting, and output of the text with some additional features. It is a fully functioned desktop publishing program that produces error-free documents.</p>
<p>A text editor is a type of computer program which helps in editing plain text. The best example of this is Notepad. Text editor helps in or provides the ability to add, remove, and change the characters or words from the given file or document. It is a type of tool for working with plain text.</p>

<h2>What is the client-server model?</h2>
<p>The Client-Server Model is a distributed architecture where clients request services and servers provide them. It underpins many modern systems, including websites, email, and cloud storage platforms.</p>

<h2>Provide a description and definition for the following network protocols: FTP, HTTP, TCP/IP</h2>
<p>The FTP functions give client access to file servers through the File Transfer Protocol (FTP).

The FTP functions are used to open, login and close connections, as well as upload, download, rename, delete, and get information on files from file servers. Not all of the FTP functions will work with every server or return the same results. </p>
<p>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a fundamental protocol of the Internet, enabling the transfer of data between a client and a server. It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.

HTTP provides a standard between a web browser and a web server to establish communication. It is a set of rules for transferring data from one computer to another. Data such as text, images, and other multimedia files are shared on the World Wide Web. Whenever a web user opens their web browser, the user indirectly uses HTTP. It is an application protocol that is used for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.</p>
<p>The TCP/IP model is a framework that is used to model the communication in a network. It is mainly a collection of network protocols and organization of these protocols in different layers for modeling the network.

One of its main goals is to make sure that the data sent by the sender arrives safely and correctly at the receiverâ€™s end. To do this, the data is broken down into smaller parts called packets before being sent. These packets travel separately and are reassembled in the correct order when they reach the destination.
